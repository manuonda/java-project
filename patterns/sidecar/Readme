### Pattern Sidecar 

In a microservices architecture, the sidecar pattern is an approach where an additional component is deployed alongside a primary microservice to handle auxiliary tasks such as communication, security, monitoring, and configuration management.	
This additional component, known as a "sidecar," runs in the same environment as the microservice (e.g., in the same pod in Kubernetes) and acts as a proxy or agent that extends the capabilities of the microservice without altering its code.
